### Abstract
The improper disposal of solid waste in Masaka, a town in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, in Nigeria, has become a major environmental and public health concern. This research project aimed to evaluate the disposal problems of solid waste management in Masaka and identify potential solutions. The study was based on a comprehensive analysis of the current solid waste management system, including the generation and disposal practices, the challenges and problems associated with waste disposal. The study utilizes Microsoft excel, ANOVA and Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference Test in python to evaluate and determine the difference in the type of waste disposed at the three different randomly selected dumpsites, the rate of waste disposal as well as the type and quantity of waste disposed of by randomly selected 50 households in Masaka. The study also makes use of three distinct categories of questionnaires around solid waste management, waste disposal by income as well as waste disposal by gender to collectively generate required qualitative, descriptive, and quantitative data needed for waste disposal evaluation from the randomly selected 50 respondents. The study also examined the impacts of these disposal problems on the environment and public health and studied best practices in solid waste management from other countries. The research found that inadequate funding and poor public participation, education on waste management and disposal methods for the Masaka community, lack of proper infrastructure, lack of government support in waste management and ineffective enforcement of waste management regulations were major challenges to proper solid waste management in Masaka. The study identified potential solutions to these challenges, including increased public education and awareness, investment in proper infrastructure, promotion of waste reduction and recycling, and the involvement of the private sector. The study recommends the use of an integrated waste management framework modeled towards achieving sustainable waste management goals and a safer environment as a way forward solution to curb the menace of improper solid waste disposal. The findings of this research can help to inform policy and decision-making and contribute to the development of a more sustainable and efficient solid waste management system in Masaka, Nasarawa State.

### RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION 
  
#### Recommendations 
  
- Establishment of an appropriate waste collection and disposal agency, along with the establishment of more government-approved dumpsites in the area. Additionally, there is a need for more collection receptacles and regular waste collection, as there are no current waste collection bins provided by the government according to our results. Moreover, it is important to increase the number of trained and qualified personnel to operate and manage various waste management equipment and system. The government should provide adequate funds for the maintenance of equipment and acquiring new ones 
  
- Instituting a strong awareness campaign to the public on the effects of waste on human health is crucial to increasing community knowledge and developing a positive attitude towards environmental hygiene. Such campaigns will also encourage the community to be active in participating crusade towards volume reduction, type, and hazardous waste toxicity, as well helping in their sound management environmentally. There is a need for training, education, and sensitizing media personnel to help equip residents with the awareness of potential emerging problems on waste management. 
  
- Enforcement of new and existing legal frameworks and Provision of monitoring is crucial to enforcing waste management laws to avoid and prevent irregular disposal of waste and ensure efficient practices of waste management. 
  
- Providing useful data with respect to waste generation, volume, collection, sources, characterization, and composition in the area is vital. A data bank is important for a very meaningful environmental planning waste management practices sustainability.
  
- Provision of sanitary landfill facilities is necessary for the proper solid waste deposition. This will help to reduce disease, pests, ground, air pollution, waste pollution in the surface, and improve aesthetic values as it provides a final resting place for solid waste. Encouraging waste recycling, composting, and reuse will become a very important and effective method in waste management, and the encouragement of private agencies to engage in general waste management effort and reusable waste recovery methods.
  
- The government should prioritize waste segregation and recycling programs. The implementation of recycling programs will reduce the amount of waste going to the landfill, thereby reducing environmental hazards. Waste segregation at the source will help ensure that recyclable materials are properly sorted and managed. 
  
- Incentivize waste reduction and recycling efforts. Encouraging residents to recycle and reduce waste by offering incentives such as tax breaks or reduced fees for waste disposal will go a long way in promoting sustainable waste management practices. 
  
- The government should regularly assess waste management practices in the area to identify gaps and areas for improvement. This will help ensure the sustainability of waste management practices and improve the quality of life for residents in the area. 
  
- The implementation of waste-to-energy technologies can also be explored to convert waste into energy. The technology can help reduce the volume of waste that goes to landfills, and the energy produced can be used to power homes and industries. 
  
- Collaboration with neighboring local governments and private organizations can also be explored to share resources and knowledge. Collaboration can help reduce the cost of waste management and improve the efficiency of waste management practices in the area. 
  
- The government should also explore the use of public-private partnerships to manage waste in the area. The private sector can bring in expertise, resources, and technology to complement the efforts of the government in managing waste in the area. 
  
- The establishment of a waste management fund can also be explored. The fund can be used to finance waste management projects and programs in the area. The fund can be financed through taxes, levies, and contributions from the private sector. 
  
- Regular monitoring and evaluation of waste management programs and initiatives is essential to identify areas for improvement and guide future efforts. Establishing a waste management committee and education and awareness campaigns should be targeted at schools. 
  
- Finally, the government should prioritize the establishment of a functional waste management regulatory framework that clearly outlines the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in waste management in the area. The framework should also provide for the enforcement of waste management laws and regulations to ensure compliance. We highly recommend our integrated waste management framework provided in this paper for proper waste management.  
  
#### Conclusion 

Our research titled “Evaluating the disposal problems of solid waste management in Nigeria using Masaka in Karu local government area, Nasarawa state, Nigeria as a case study”, has shown us a path towards understanding the problems of waste disposal in Masaka. Through this research we were able to evaluate the current state of waste disposal and management in Masaka, critically analyze the data generated using different statistical means and visualize and discuss the result of our analysis. Through our results, we were able to design and model a waste management framework which we believed would improve the current state of waste management and disposal in Masaka.  
It is clear that effective waste management is a critical issue in Masaka, Karu location, and requires a multi-faceted approach. The recommendations presented above, ranging from instituting appropriate waste collection and disposal agencies to promoting the use of eco-friendly products, are aimed at addressing the various challenges faced in managing solid waste in the area. However, their successful implementation requires the cooperation and commitment of all stakeholders, including the government, waste management personnels, residents, and businesses. With a concerted effort, the challenges of waste management can be overcome, leading to a healthier and more sustainable environment in Masaka, Karu location.
